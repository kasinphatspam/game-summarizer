    "rephrased_text": "Now Playing: Super Mario Party Jamboree Video Review | This Party Is Overcrowded  \nSuper Mario Party Jamboree concludes this trilogy on the Switch by striving to strike a balance between its two predecessors but ultimately falls into the trap of prioritizing quantity over quality. Players will select their characters, determine the number of turns, and set out to collect coins in a bid to secure more stars than their competitors. There are several appealing changes and new features, such as a timeline displayed at the bottom of the screen that indicates the order of turns and board events. However, the most significant alteration to the traditional format is found in the Jamboree Buddies and Showdown Minigames."
